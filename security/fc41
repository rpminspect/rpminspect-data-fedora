# Security rules for the test suite
#
# One package per line.  Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are
# ignored.  Malformed lines are ignored, but a warning is displayed.
# The first matching rule in this file is used by rpminspect, so be
# careful of ordering of explicit files and packages and then wildcard
# rules.
#
# Each rule consists of five fields separated by spaces or tabs (any
# number):
#
#     path           The file or path, can use glob(7) syntax
#     name           The name of the package, can use glob(7) syntax
#     version        The package version, can use glob(7) syntax
#     release        The package release, can use glob(7) syntax
#     rules          Comma-delimited list of security rules where each
#                    element is RULE=ACTION.
#
# It is common to establish per-file rules in a specific package, but
# with glob(7) syntax it is possible to write a rule that applies to
# all files in a package.  Just be aware of what you are writing in
# the fields because security rules should favor more explicit
# matching over wildcard matching.  The most common fields to carry
# '*' values should be version and release.
#
# Available RULES (case-insensitive in the config file):
#
#     caps           Check file capabilities(7)
#     execstack      Check for executable stack in ELF objects or programs
#                    built without GNU_STACK.
#     relro          Check for ELF objects losing GNU_RELRO protection.
#     fortifysource  Check for ELF objects losing -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE.
#     pic            Check for ELF objects built without -fPIC in static
#                    libraries.
#     textrel        Check for an TEXTREL relocations.
#     setuid         Check for CAP_SETUID and group writable permissions.
#     worldwritable  Check for world writable permissions.
#     securitypath   Check for loss of file(s) that belong in a security
#                    path prefix.
#     modes          Check for expected file ownership and permissions.
#
# Available ACTIONS (case-insensitive in the config file):
#
#     SKIP           The finding is ignored.
#     INFORM         The finding is reported at the INFO level, which does
#                    not trigger a failing exit code.
#     VERIFY         The finding is reported at the VERIFY level, which does
#                    trigger a failing exit code.
#     FAIL           The finding is reported at the BAD level, which does
#                    trigger a failing exit code.
